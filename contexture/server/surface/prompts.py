"""What a person triggers by name: declared commands, and `goto`.

MCP's prompt primitive is the *user-controlled* one — a person picks an entry
from a menu their host shows. So what is hung here is not a second surface for
the model but a second way in for whoever owns this server.

Two kinds of entry, and they are the same door addressed two ways:

    a declared command    carries its ref in its registration
    goto                  carries its ref in an argument, completed as it is typed

Both go through `SystemAPI.open_for_a_person`, so a command and `contexture_open`
cannot answer differently about one node. That matters more than it sounds:
reaching a capability two ways and being told two different things about how to
call it is worse than either answer alone.
