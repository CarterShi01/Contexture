"""What a host may take up on its own: documents, at addresses of their own.

MCP's resource primitive is the *application-controlled* one — a host decides
when to read one, without asking a model and without a person picking it. Each
entry names a node the tree already holds, so a procedure can cite a document by
the name the document gives itself and a model can reach the same bytes by
navigating to it. One capability, two addresses; not two declarations that can
disagree.
