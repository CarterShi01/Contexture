"""The doors this server opens, and the one object that installs them.

MCP splits its primitives by *who decides when one is used*, and this package
splits the same way — one door per primitive, each owning its own entries, its
own rules, and its own install:

    tools.py       the four fixed entries a model drives; a business adds none
    prompts.py     what a person triggers by name, plus `goto`
    resources.py   what a host may take up on its own

This replaced `projection/` hanging things off an `Assembly` data bag. The bag
held a mixed `published` list and split it by `isinstance` at every use; now the
two typed lists arrive already apart, and each door reads only its own.

**Constructed, then installed.** Every door validates in its constructor, and
`Surface.of` constructs all three before `install` writes any of them onto the
SDK server — so a declaration error is raised while that server does not yet
exist, instead of half way through hanging things on one. It is this package's
own idiom: a constructor is where a declaration is checked (ADR 013).

What is checked *here* rather than in `core` is what would stop being true if
MCP were replaced. That a published entry names a node the tree holds is about
addresses and is settled with the index; that two entries cannot share a name is
about a flat menu, and that a resource must be read-only and argument-free is
about a primitive that is fetched rather than called. Those are facts about this
protocol, so they live beside the code that speaks it.
