"""The object a business application hands to its host.

A project registers its graph, compiles it, and serves it::

    def main() -> None:
        manager = ControllerManager(channels=channels)
        manager.register_role(KubernetesPlatform)

        index = Index.of(manager, bind=TypeHintBinding)

        server = ContextureServer(
            index,
            name="oc-goal",
            prompts=[RollBackARelease],
            resources=[CrashLoopRunbook, RollbackPolicy],
        )
        server.start(ContextureOptions(transport="stdio"))

Nothing above that last line mentions JSON-RPC, JSON Schema, stdio framing, or
any particular agent runtime. That is the whole claim the framework makes:
declare once, and Claude Code, Codex, and anything else that speaks MCP connect
to the same server.

**It takes a compiled index and has no way to register anything.** That is the
phase boundary, made structural rather than written down: you register into a
`ControllerManager`, you compile it once into an `Index`, and only then does a
server exist. There is no method here that could add a node to a graph that is
already being served, which is what the protocol forbids and what a run-time
flag could only complain about after the fact.

**It deliberately does not subclass the SDK's `MCPServer`.** The runtime owns
roles and disclosure; the SDK owns the wire. Keeping them as two objects that
compose is what lets the domain model stay testable without a transport, and
what keeps an SDK upgrade from reaching into the object model.

**Two objects, because they are fixed at two different times.**
`ContextureServer` is identity and topology — what is served, and what it is
called — settled before the process starts and unchanged after.
`ContextureOptions` is how to serve it: which transport, which address, who is
allowed to knock. Serving the same graph on a laptop and in a cluster changes
the second and none of the first.
