"""The inbound MCP surface: Contexture served as a native MCP server.

This is the layer the two mental models meet in. A business application
declares its context once in `contexture.core`, and every agent runtime —
Claude Code, Codex, anything else that speaks MCP — connects to the one server
this package builds, rather than reading a file compiled for it in advance.

**What** this server exposes is declared one layer down, in
`core.mcp_interface`, one module per MCP primitive. This package is **how**:
the SDK calls, the dispatch, and every sentence said to whoever is reading.

The responsibilities change at different rates, so they are separate modules
rather than one:

    surface/        the doors this server opens, one module per MCP primitive,
                    and the `Surface` that installs them. Moves when the SDK does.
    server          the container: one compiled index, built and served
    options         how to serve it — transport, address, who may knock
    binding         the one seam `core` opens: a tool's schema, and running it
                    with its arguments checked and its caller in reach
    identity        who is calling: the socket a business plugs its token
                    verifier into, and the protocol facts around it. Moves
                    when the authorization specification does.
    messages        everything said *to* somebody: the bootstrap text, the
                    sentence a failed lookup becomes, what a person reads at
                    the top of a command. Moves when the way an agent is
                    taught to walk the tree changes.
    instructions    fitting that text into one host's budget. Moves when Claude
                    Code or Codex ships.

`launch` emits the one file a host still needs — the command that starts this
server — and belongs to none of them.

This facade resolves its exports lazily so that the modules which do not import
the SDK — `messages` and `launch` — stay importable, and testable, without a
wire in the room.
