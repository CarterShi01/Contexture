"""How a graph is served: which transport, which address, who may knock.

Not *what* is served, and not what it is called — those are settled before the
process starts and unchanged after, and they live on `ContextureServer`. This
module is the other half, and the split is why there are two objects: serving
the same graph on a laptop and in a cluster changes everything here and nothing
there.

    ))

`configure_logging` is here for the same reason: under stdio the protocol owns
stdout, so where log records go is a fact about serving.
