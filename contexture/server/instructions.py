"""Fitting the contract into one host's budget.

What this text *says* is `contexture.server.messages`'s business. What fits is
this module's, and the two are separated because they change for unrelated
reasons: the contract moves when the navigation model does, these numbers move
when a host ships a release.

Two host limits shape this file, and both are real rather than defensive:

* Claude Code truncates server instructions at 2KB and loads them at session
  start, before any tool schema.
* Codex reads the same field and asks that the first 512 characters be
  self-contained, because that is what it has in hand while deciding whether
  to use the server at all.

A roster is included here rather than left for the first
`contexture_discover` call. It is static, it is small — a role card is a name,
a sentence and a path — and putting it here answers the question a host asks
before it has called anything: *what is this server for?* Without it, a gateway
server presents four tools whose names all begin with `contexture_` and no
sign that any of them lead to Kubernetes. With it, the first call can be the
one that opens the right role.

Unlike `contexture_discover`, which answers with the roots and nothing below
them, this roster keeps going while there is budget left: it costs no round
trip, and a small forest fits whole. It walks **breadth-first**, because a
roster is a list that gets cut off, and a depth-first cut spends the budget on
one deep spine while never mentioning the root's siblings — the worst possible
answer for text whose only job is routing.

Breadth-first fixes the axis the budget is spent along. It does not, on its
own, stop the budget running out *inside* one parent's children, and a roster
that lists three of a role's eight sub-roles is worse than one that lists none
of them: the three look like the whole choice. So the budget is spent in whole
sibling groups. A group is listed only if all of it fits, which keeps the rule
ADR 004 stated and ADR 007 kept — every sibling is visible before the choice,
and what cannot be seen together is opened rather than guessed between.

The roots are the exception, and are cut entry by entry when even they do not
fit. A roster with no roots says nothing about what the server is for, which is
the one job this text has; and since ADR 007 the roots are exactly what
`contexture_discover` answers with, so a cut root list is the only incomplete
group a single named call restores. The message says which call.
