"""The four entry points, and the reason a business capability is not among them.

MCP tool lists are flat and, since the 2026-07-28 revision, stateless: a server
may not vary them per connection or as a consequence of an earlier call. So a
capability that is registered is a capability every session pays for, forever,
whatever the user asked. The only way a tool becomes deferrable is for it not
to be on the surface at all — its name, description and schema travel inside a
payload instead, and arrive when the role holding it is opened.

What is on the surface is four tools, whatever the declaration contains::

    contexture_discover              the root roles, one level
    contexture_open                  one node's detail, plus its members' cards
    contexture_invoke_read_only      run a tool that leaves the world unchanged
    contexture_invoke                run a tool that does not

**`read_only` is which door, not which argument.** A host cannot see a business
tool any more, so it cannot be told per tool whether to ask a human first. It
can see which of the two doors was used, and each door carries the matching
`readOnlyHint`. A model may pick the wrong one — and picking it gets the call
refused rather than executed, which is the same protection as never letting the
classification be an argument, relocated to where the host can still act on it.

Nothing is checked in this plane's constructor because a business declares
nothing on it. It is a class all the same, so that `build` reads as three
planes rather than two planes and an exception.
