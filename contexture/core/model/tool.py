                ...

    A constructor that hands its identity to the base, and an `invoke` that is
    the behaviour. Nothing is inferred: not from the class name, which a
    TypeScript bundler rewrites, and not from the docstring, which no Go or
    TypeScript runtime can read. What an agent reads is written down.

    **The class is not the node.** Nothing here is built when this module is
    imported — a class is a zero-argument factory, and the parent role's own
    constructor is what calls it. So a graph comes into existence when a
    `ControllerManager` registers its root, which is the only moment a node can
    be told where it hangs and handed what it may reach.

    The parameter schema is never written by hand *in this implementation*. It
    is derived from `invoke`'s type hints when the tool is projected onto an MCP
    surface, which is why nothing in this layer needs to know what JSON Schema
    looks like. A Go or TypeScript implementation cannot read a signature that
    way and states an argument object instead; what conformance pins is the
    schema that reaches the wire, never how it was derived.

    `read_only` is a trusted host classification, not an agent-supplied
    argument. It is projected onto the protocol's `readOnlyHint` annotation so a
    host can decide whether to ask a human before running the tool, and it must
    never appear in the tool's input schema.

    A Tool is the only node the framework executes on the agent's behalf, and
    that is what separates it from the other three. A Skill describes work the
    model performs; a Tool performs work the model asked for. So the question
    that places something here is whether the answer can be *computed* — if
    producing it requires judgement, the model must do it and what belongs in
    the declaration is a Skill.

    Content this application already holds is a read-only Tool that takes no
    arguments: two calls return the same bytes, and it computes nothing. A host
    may publish one at a URI of its own — see `core.mcp_interface.resource` —
    but that is a second name for it, not a second kind of node.

    **One instance serves the whole process, so `invoke` must be re-entrant.**
    A Tool is built once, when the tree is, and every call to it — from every
    session, and from calls a host issues in parallel on one session — arrives
    at that same object. The SDK dispatches each request as its own task, so
    two `invoke` bodies interleave at every `await`. Writing per-call state onto
    `self` therefore loses it: the second call overwrites what the first read
    and had not yet used. Keep what a call needs in its arguments and its
    locals. This is a constraint on the object, not on your domain — locking,
    transactions, and idempotency belong to whatever `invoke` talks to, and the
    framework will never offer its own.

    Python will not enforce this. `Tool` is slotted, but a subclass that is not
    itself a slotted dataclass carries a `__dict__`, so `self.anything = ...`
    inside `invoke` silently succeeds and silently shares.
