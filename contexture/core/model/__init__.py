"""The kernel: what a capability is, where it hangs, and what an agent may do.

Three kinds of node, one disclosure lifecycle, one forest, and the four system
entry points an agent calls against it. Nothing here knows that MCP exists,
what JSON Schema looks like, or how a request reaches this process.

A node still cannot *work out* where it hangs — it is told, by the
`ControllerManager` that registered it, in segments rather than in an address.
What changed in ADR 014 is only who joins those segments up: `ContextTree`
spells the reference and decides which nodes one call answers with, and it sits
here rather than in a layer of its own, because the call that discloses a node
and the node that discloses itself are two halves of one mechanism.

A business subclasses these and states what each one is in its constructor,
which hands that identity to the base and builds whatever the node holds.
Nothing is inferred from a class name or a docstring, and nothing is built when
a declaration is imported: a class is a zero-argument factory, and a
`ControllerManager` is the one place every node comes into existence.

# is about to serve something.
