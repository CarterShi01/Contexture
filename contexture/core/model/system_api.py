"""The four calls an agent may make, and everything it is told when one fails.

This is the framework's own API, and the only one an agent ever sees. A
declaration of any size projects onto exactly these four::

    contexture_discover              the roots, one level
    contexture_open                  one node's detail, plus its members' cards
    contexture_invoke_read_only      run a tool that leaves the world unchanged
    contexture_invoke                run a tool that does not

**They are not `Tool` nodes and must not become any.** A `Tool` is something a
business declares, hangs in a role, and pays for by disclosure; these are fixed
logic that exists before any declaration and is identical for every one of
them. Modelling them as nodes would put the framework's own plumbing into the
forest it is supposed to be disclosing.

**Why they live in `core` rather than in `server`.** Their identity used to sit
in `core.mcp_interface` and their behaviour in `server`, with the tree they act
on in a third place — and the seam left a mark: the sentence a failed lookup
becomes has to name the call that recovers from it, which meant the sentence
could not be written where the failure happened. It can now. Navigation is the
kernel's (ADR 014), so the names of the calls that navigate belong to the
kernel too, and so do the words it says when one of them is refused.

**What is *not* here.** Nothing about a wire: no JSON-RPC, no JSON Schema
derivation, no argument validation, no transport. One seam carries all of them
in from `server` — the `Binding` the tree holds for each tool — and this module
never inspects it. It was two seams until ADR 016, which is how a card's schema
and the check applied to a call could have come from two derivations.

The bootstrap text a host loads before calling anything is not here either. It
teaches the same four calls, but what fits in one host's instructions field is a
fact about that host's release, so it stays in `contexture.server.instructions`.
