    **Members are built here, never discovered.** Three lists rather than one,
    because which of the three a capability belongs in is the modelling
    decision this framework asks a business to make. The three also survive
    translation: they are three typed slices in Go and three typed arrays in
    TypeScript, where one mixed list is neither.

    **Building them inside this constructor is what defers everything.** The
    members of a role that nobody registers are never constructed, and two
    registrations of one class are two independent subtrees — which matters as
    soon as anything is stamped onto a node, because a shared member would take
    the last stamp written anywhere in the process.

    **Membership is fixed once a tree has been built from this role.** The four
    member lists are ordinary lists, and assembling one at runtime is supported
    — that is what the imperative door is for. Changing one *after* the role is
    serving is not: since the 2026-07-28 revision a server may not vary its
    surface as a consequence of an earlier call, and an `append` here does
    exactly that. It also skips the uniqueness, cycle, and
    separator checks, which all run at construction. Build the graph you mean to serve, then leave it alone;
    `tests/test_binding.py` holds the statelessness this depends on.

    #              halves of buys the round trip and none of the saving.
