"""The multi-headed tree, disclosed lazily.

Below this module sits `ContextNode.compile()`, which every node answers for
itself. Above it sit the four system entry points `core.model.system_api` puts
in front of an agent. This module is the whole of what joins them, and the whole
of the navigation model.

**One call shows one level of siblings.** Choosing between siblings requires
seeing all of them — what cannot be seen together is guessed between rather than
chosen between — so a level always arrives whole. It does not follow that every
level should arrive at once, and until v0.2.0 this module drew that conclusion:
`skeleton()` walked the entire forest, which is affordable at the six roles the
argument was traced against and is 440,000 tokens at eleven thousand. `discover`
now answers with the roots, and each `open` answers with one more level of
sub-roles alongside everything else that role holds. The role axis is as lazy as
every other axis; see ADR 007.

**A reference is a path.**::

    kubernetes-incident-responder
    kubernetes-incident-responder/diagnose-crash-loop-backoff

No kind prefix, no second separator. The members of one role are uniquely named,
so resolution can simply look rather than be told where to look, and the address
reads like something a person could have written. An agent never has to write
one: every card carries the reference that opens it, because `card` cannot be
called without a view to take one from.

**Three objects, three questions.** `ControllerManager` owns what exists; `Index`
owns the facts derived from it — every address, every binding, what only the
whole forest can answer; and this owns *how much of that one call gives back*.
It is the disclosure strategy and nothing else: it holds an `Index`, and reaches
for the address and schema it cannot work out for a node from there. Registration
is additive and mutable, an index is compiled and frozen, and this is the view
served over one — the split is why a skill in the first registered root may name
a capability in the second. See ADR 014 and ADR 016.

**Nothing here is remembered.** Every method is a pure function of its argument,
which is what keeps traversal legal on a protocol that, since the 2026-07-28
revision, forbids a server to vary its surface per connection or as a consequence
of an earlier call.

    by the MCP SDK; nothing here imports it.

    It satisfies `View`, which is how a node reaches the two things it cannot
    work out for itself: the address that opens it, and the schema an agent
    needs in order to call it. Both come from the index, which is the one object
