"""What one tool needs in order to be described and to be run.

`core` cannot derive a JSON Schema — it does not import the SDK, and the three
implementations of this framework do not agree on how a schema is produced
anyway: Python reads `invoke`'s signature, Go reflects an argument struct,
TypeScript declares a schema object. What conformance pins is the schema that
reaches the wire, never how it was derived.

So `core` states the shape and fills it with the honest minimum. A `Binding` is
**one tool's** two derived facts:

    schema      what a card carries, so an agent knows how to call it
    call        run it with those arguments checked

**They are two views of one derivation, and that is why they are one object.**
A schema written on a card by one thing and a check applied to a call by
another is the worst kind of drift: an agent calls exactly what it was told to
call and is refused. Here neither can move without the other.

**One per tool, made once.** A binding is derived when the forest is compiled
and stored beside the address it belongs to. What this replaces was a single
process-wide object holding a dictionary keyed by `id(tool)` — a per-tool fact
implemented as a global table, which then needed a paragraph explaining when an
`id` may be reused. An address is stable and unique, so the paragraph goes.

The strategy that produces one is named where the SDK is:

    index = Index.of(manager, bind=TypeHintBinding)     # Python
    index = Index.of(manager, bind=StructTagBinding)    # Go, in spirit
