"""Read the disclosure text yourself, one step at a time.

Everything an agent is told by this server is generated: the bootstrap
instructions, the routing cards, a skill's procedure, the sentence a wrong
reference becomes. The test suite asserts that text. Nothing until now let the
person who *wrote* it read it back.

That is the gap this module fills. It replays a session the way a host walks
one — the instructions loaded at connect, then `contexture_discover`, then one
`contexture_open` per reference — and hands back exactly what would have
arrived, with what it cost. No transport, no model, no agent in the room.

**It calls the same functions the server does.** `instructions.build`,
`ContextTree.skeleton`, `ContextTree.open`, `system_api.unresolved`: the four
wrappers in `contexture.server.projection.gateway` do nothing but forward to
these, so a payload printed here is the payload sent there, character for
character. What this cannot see is the wire — that the process starts under a
host's launch command, and that nothing but MCP messages reaches stdout. Both
are only visible from outside the process, which is what
`tests/test_stdio_server.py` pays a subprocess for.

Two things are deliberately not replayed. `contexture_invoke` is not, because
running a business tool is not disclosure and a debugging command should not
change anything. Reading content is, but only when asked for: a document's
content is often the largest single thing an agent receives, so its cost
belongs in the accounting, while reading it runs business code that may want
credentials nobody supplied.

**This module is public, and is not on the `contexture` facade.** Both halves
are deliberate. `contexture inspect` is a thin front end over it, and the names
in `__all__` are meant to be imported: a project that wants its context budget
watched in CI asserts against `as_json(trace(...))` rather than parsing the
printed form. It stays off the facade because that facade exports what a
business developer *declares* with, and this is read at development time — it
sits above `server` and belongs to no layer inside `core` (ADR 010). Importing
it costs no SDK: it reaches `server.messages` and `server.instructions` for the
text and the budget, and never for the wire.

Cost is reported as characters, UTF-8 bytes, and an *estimated* token count.
The estimate is one token per wide character plus a quarter token per
everything else — enough to tell 300 tokens from 3,000, and not a tokenizer.
Where a real limit exists it is checked in the unit it is actually enforced in:
Claude Code truncates the instructions field at 2,048 bytes, Codex reads the
first 512 characters.
