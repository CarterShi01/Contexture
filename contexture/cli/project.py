"""Finding a project, reading what it declared, and resolving it to objects.

A business project is *served*, not distributed. It has no build system and is
never installed into the environment, so this module locates it the way Scrapy
locates a crawl project: walk up for the marker — a `pyproject.toml` carrying a
`[tool.contexture]` table — and put that directory on `sys.path`.

Moves when the packaging ecosystem does, which is why it is not in `main`.
