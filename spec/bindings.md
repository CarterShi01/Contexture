# Language binding notes

This page is non-normative. The normative contract is
[model.md](model.md), [conformance.md](conformance.md), fixtures, and golden
outputs.

| Binding | Public authoring surface | Tool-schema strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | top-level facade, base classes, `.pyi`, `py.typed` | type hints on `invoke()` |
| TypeScript | package export map, classes/interfaces, `.d.ts` | explicit schema object coupled to a typed handler |
| Go | exported structs and interfaces; implementation hidden under `internal/` | tagged input struct |
| PHP | Composer namespace, abstract classes/interfaces, PHPDoc/PHPStan | DTO or explicit schema object |

All bindings must preserve lazy Application construction, explicit identity,
Role/Skill/Tool semantics, ref grammar, Channels lifecycle, fixed gateway, and
the produced Tool schema. No binding is required to reproduce Python class
inheritance or reflection.
