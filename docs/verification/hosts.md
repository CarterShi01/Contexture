# Host verification

Two records. The v0.2.0 run below is the current one; the v0.0.4 run is kept
underneath it as recorded, because it verified a surface that no longer exists.

# v0.2.0 — the five-tool gateway

Recorded 2026-08-19 against `57eb59b`, on a machine that has the SDK, `uv`,
`node`, both host CLIs, and a network — none of which the machine that wrote
`HANDOFF.md` had.

The claim under test: **a model will choose to navigate a gateway.** Everything
else about the gateway was already mechanically proven by
`tests/test_stdio_server.py`; what no test can prove is that a model does not
simply give up when every capability is hidden behind a generic dispatch tool.

## Claude Code

Run headlessly, with only the five gateway tools allowed, so nothing could be
answered by reading this repository:

```bash
claude -p "<pod payments-api-7d9c in prod is unhealthy; find the root cause \
using the contexture-demo MCP server; do not guess>" \
  --mcp-config mcp.json \
  --allowed-tools "mcp__contexture-demo__contexture_discover,\
mcp__contexture-demo__contexture_open,mcp__contexture-demo__contexture_read,\
mcp__contexture-demo__contexture_invoke_read_only,\
mcp__contexture-demo__contexture_invoke" \
  --output-format stream-json --verbose
```

### The traversal, as it happened

```text
1. contexture_discover
2. contexture_open           kubernetes-platform/incident-response
3. contexture_open           kubernetes-platform/incident-response/diagnose-crash-loop-backoff
4. contexture_invoke_read_only  .../get_pod_status  {namespace, pod}
5. contexture_invoke_read_only  .../get_pod_logs    {namespace, pod, previous: true}
6. contexture_invoke_read_only  .../get_pod_events  {namespace, pod}
7. contexture_read           contexture://runbooks/crash-loop-backoff
```

**Nine turns, eight tool calls, zero errors.** `is_error: false` on every one.

### The four questions HANDOFF item 3 asked

1. **Does the host open a role before reaching for a tool?** Yes, and it opened
   the skill too. Calls 1–3 are pure navigation; the first invoke is call 4.
2. **When it passes a ref that does not resolve, does the sentence get it back
   in one turn?** **Not observed — it never passed a bad ref.** A good outcome
   that leaves the question open. `contract.unresolved()` still has no field
   evidence, and forcing one synthetically would not be that evidence.
   (Legibility on the wire *is* confirmed separately: a wrong ref returns the
   members the role does hold plus the call that recovers, and both wrong-door
   refusals name the other door.)
3. **Does either host truncate the instructions?** No. The demo's full
   instructions are **884 characters** against Claude Code's 2KB, and the
   preamble is **465** against Codex's 512-character self-contained window —
   both re-measured against this commit rather than read off documentation. The
   roster budget does bind: forty roots render to 1806 characters, still inside
   2KB.

### What it did beyond connecting

- **Followed the disclosed procedure in order** — status → logs → events —
  which exists only inside the skill it opened at step 3.
- **Read an optional parameter off the card schema.** It passed
  `previous: true` to `get_pod_logs`; nothing in the prompt suggested it.
- **Addressed the resource by its own URI**, not by its ref — the spelling
  `ContextTree.resource()` accepts so a procedure can name a document the way
  the document names itself.
- **Obeyed the skill's constraint**: it refused to recommend restarting the Pod,
  and said why (restart 15).
- **Respected the disclosure boundary.** It closed by noting it had not opened
  `kubernetes-platform/deployment-ops` and would therefore not assert anything
  about the release history. It declined to guess about a role it had seen a
  card for and not opened, which is the behaviour the whole design is betting
  on.

## Codex

Registration against v0.2.0 succeeds and needs no Codex-specific artifact:

```bash
codex mcp add contexture-demo -- /path/to/.venv/bin/python -m contexture.examples.incident.server
codex mcp list
# contexture-demo  …  enabled  Unsupported
```

The diagnosis run is blocked by the same account limit that blocked it at
v0.0.4:

```text
ERROR: You've hit your usage limit. … try again at Aug 21st, 2026 12:02 PM.
```

The server stays registered, so the run is one command away once the limit
resets. See `scripts/verify_codex.md`.

# Host verification — v0.0.4

Recorded 2026-08-19 against the branch `feature/native-mcp-server`.

> **This record predates v0.1.0 and is kept as recorded, not updated.** It shows
> the surface as it was: business tools registered natively, and
> `contexture_get_context` where `contexture_open` now stands. What it verifies
> is still the claim under test — one server, one launch command, two hosts, no

The claim under test: **one server, one launch command, two hosts, no generated
context files.**

Run headlessly with only the server's own tools allowed, so nothing could be
answered by reading this repository:

```bash
claude -p "Use the contexture-demo MCP server to diagnose why pod \
payments-api-7d9c in namespace prod keeps restarting. Start from Contexture's \

  --allowedTools \

    "mcp__contexture-demo__contexture_get_context" \
    "mcp__contexture-demo__get_pod_status" \
    "mcp__contexture-demo__get_pod_logs" \
    "mcp__contexture-demo__get_pod_events" \
    "ReadMcpResource"
```

Result: 12 turns, no permission denials, `is_error: false`.

What the run demonstrates, point by point:

* It **found the role and skill through discovery**, not through the filesystem —
  it names `kubernetes-incident-responder` and `diagnose-crash-loop-backoff`,
  which appear nowhere except in the server's responses.
* It **followed the disclosed procedure in order** (status → logs → events →
  runbook), which only reached it via `contexture_get_context`.
* It **read the resource** rather than being handed its content up front.
* It **obeyed the constraint** that exists only inside the skill: it explicitly
  refused to recommend restarting the Pod first.
* It **distinguished exit 1 from exit 137**, which is the runbook's own test for
  separating a config failure from an OOM kill.

### Transcript

```text
## Diagnosis: `prod/payments-api-7d9c`

I started from the server's disclosed role (`kubernetes-incident-responder`), took its `diagnose-crash-loop-backoff` skill, and followed that procedure in order: status → logs → events → runbook.

**Evidence collected**

| Source | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| `get_pod_status` | `phase: Running`, `container_state: CrashLoopBackOff`, `restart_count: 14`, `ready: false`, image `registry.internal/payments-api:1.8.2` |
| `get_pod_logs` | `ERROR ConfigurationError: required environment variable DB_URL is missing`, followed by `FATAL startup aborted after configuration error` |
| `get_pod_events` | `Created container payments-api` ×15, `BackOff: Back-off restarting failed container` ×14, `Unhealthy: Container exited with code 1` ×14 |

**Root cause**

The container is missing the required environment variable `DB_URL`. The application reads its configuration at startup, finds `DB_URL` absent, logs `ConfigurationError`, and aborts before serving anything. It exits with **code 1** — an application-level self-rejection, not a kill. Per the runbook, exit 1 is what separates this from an OOM kill (which would be exit 137 and a different runbook), so memory limits are not implicated. The image pulls and the container is created successfully all 15 times, which rules out image or scheduling problems: the failure is entirely inside startup config loading.

Matching against the runbook's cause table, this is row one: *`ConfigurationError`, missing variable → Config or Secret not projected into the Pod.*

**Next remediation step**

Add the `DB_URL` key to the ConfigMap or Secret referenced by the `payments-api` Pod spec (and confirm the spec actually projects that key into the container as an env var), then roll out the Deployment.

Do not restart or delete the Pod first. The 14 restarts already performed are the same operation the kubelet is retrying automatically; a manual restart repairs nothing and just produces restart 15.

One scope note: the MCP tools here expose status, logs, and events only — there's no tool to read the ConfigMap/Secret or the Pod spec, so I can't tell you from evidence *which* object is missing the key or whether it's an absent key versus a broken `valueFrom` reference. That distinction needs a look at the workload manifest.
```

## Codex

Registration succeeded and the server is listed:

```bash
codex mcp add contexture-demo -- /path/to/.venv/bin/contexture demo
codex mcp list
# contexture-demo  …/contexture demo  -  -  -  enabled  Unsupported
```

The diagnosis run could **not** be completed:

```text
ERROR: You've hit your usage limit. … try again at Aug 21st, 2026 12:02 PM.
```

So **Codex is unverified end to end.** What is verified is that it accepts the
same launch command with no Codex-specific artifacts. The protocol path itself
is covered independently by `tests/test_stdio_server.py`, which drives the same
subprocess with the official SDK client over real stdio — including the legacy
handshake revision Codex may negotiate — but that is not a substitute for
running Codex itself.

To finish this row once the limit resets, see `scripts/verify_codex.md`.

## Automated equivalent

`tests/test_stdio_server.py` launches the demo as a subprocess and drives it
over real stdio with the official client, asserting:

* the 2026-07-28 revision is negotiated through `server/discover`
* a legacy host using `initialize` still gets a working server
* server instructions fit both hosts' limits (512-char opening, 2KB total)
* `read_only` appears as an annotation and in no input schema
* the full traversal produces the intended evidence
* a skill's procedure is absent from bootstrap and from every routing card, and
  present only after `contexture_get_context`
* resource content is absent from listing and from disclosure, and present only
  after a read
