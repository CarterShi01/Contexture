"""Tests for the two planes of text that are still `server`'s.

What one call answers with, refusals included, moved to the kernel with the
calls themselves; `tests/test_system_api.py` holds it. What is left here is the
text shaped by its audience rather than by the model — the opening a host loads
before calling anything, and what a person reads in a command menu.

These run without the MCP SDK installed, and that is the point: what a host is
told is decided a layer below the wire, and it should be readable, assertable
and reviewable on its own.
