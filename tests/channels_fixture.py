"""A server whose capabilities reach something outside their own process.

Launched as a subprocess by `test_channels.py`. It is written the way an
application with downstream connections is meant to be written, and the order
is the point: the connection is built first, handed to the registry, and only
then is anything registered against it.

The "connection" here is a dictionary rather than a socket. What is being
tested is that a capability reaches *the object the application built*, and a
real socket would only add a second thing that can fail.
