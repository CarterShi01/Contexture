"""Capture everything this server says, so a refactor cannot change one word.

`spec/golden/` holds the exact bytes the bundled demo produces: the four entry
points as a host lists them, the instructions a host reads first, every payload
`contexture_open` answers with, every sentence a refusal becomes, what a person
gets from a command, and what a host gets from a resource read.

**This is the safety net, and it is deliberately dumb.** It asserts nothing
about *why* a payload looks the way it does — `tests/` does that. It asserts
that the bytes are the same as they were, which is the one thing a large
refactor cannot verify by reading.

It is also the first instalment of what the README promises as `spec/golden/`:
the same files a Go or TypeScript implementation has to reproduce.

Regenerate deliberately, never casually::
