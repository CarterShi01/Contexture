"""The server `test_http_server.py` launches, in its own process.

Not a test module — the discovery pattern is `test*.py`, which is why this is
named the way it is. It exists as a file rather than as a string passed to
`python -c` so that what is being served can be read like ordinary code, and
so that it is exactly the shape the README tells a developer to write.

Two tools and one verifier, which is the smallest arrangement that can show
the whole claim: identity arrives from the wire, reaches a capability's own
code, and the capability — not the framework — decides what to do about it.
