"""The four calls an agent makes, exercised without a wire.

**No MCP SDK is imported here, and that is the point of the module.** Until
ADR 014 the only place the whole sequence could be observed was
`test_stdio_server.py`, which launches a subprocess and needs the SDK
installed; a checkout without it could not run a single assertion about what an
agent actually receives. The behaviour never depended on the wire — resolution,
levels, the two doors and every refusal are the kernel's — so the tests do not
either, and the wire-level suite is left with the claims that genuinely need a
wire: that the surface really is these four names, that the read-only hint is
attached, and that nothing but protocol reaches stdout.

The trace below is the one `docs/verification/hosts.md` records a host taking.
