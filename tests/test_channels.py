"""What a capability reaches outside its own process, and how it got there.

A Tool is built by the declaration machinery and shared by every call in the
process, so it cannot hold a connection — it has to be handed one. These tests
check the whole path that hand-off travels: an application builds its
connections, registers its controllers against them, and a capability reached
through the wire finds the object the application built.

The in-process cases pin the mechanism. The stdio case pins the claim, because
a resource read and a tool call arrive through different SDK machinery and only
a real client exercises both.
