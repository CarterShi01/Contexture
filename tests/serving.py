"""Register, compile and serve — `main()`'s steps, for a test.

Not part of the framework. A business `main()` writes these lines out in full,
because every object in them is one it makes a decision about; a test makes the
same decisions the same way every time, so it says so once here.

    server = serve(Responder)                    # one root, nothing published
    server = serve(Responder, published=(DOC,))  # …and one document

`published` is a convenience this helper keeps: a test states a mixed tuple and
it is sorted into the two planes here, the way `cli` sorts a project's publish
table. The framework itself takes the two typed lists apart — `prompts=` and
`resources=` on `ContextureServer`.

`surface` and `tree` are reachable from what comes back, which is what the tests
that read `app.surface.tree` want.
